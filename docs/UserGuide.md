# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* You have to supply values for parameters in `UPPER_CASE`.<br>
  e.g. In `add d/DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add d/cucumber`.

* Parameters are compulsory unless they are in square brackets.<br>
  e.g `d/DESCRIPTION e/EXPIRY_DATE [p/PRIORITY]` can be used as `d/bread e/30-09-2020` or as `d/bread e/30-09-2020 p/low`.
  However, it cannot be used as `e/30-09-2020 p/low` because the description is missing.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. If the command specifies `d/DESCRIPTION e/EXPIRY_DATE`, `e/EXPIRY_DATE d/DESCRIPTION` is also acceptable.

</div>

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Viewing help

The `help` command shows a help message explaining how to access the user guide.
After entering this command, you should see a pop-up window similar to the one shown below.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

**Format:** `help`

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Viewing expired food items

When you launch the app, it checks for any expired food items present in your food inventory. This lets you easily see what food items have expired.
If there is any expired food item, a pop-up window similar to the one shown below will appear with the list of expired food item(s).
If you have discarded the expired food item, please remember to delete the associated food item from the app using the [`delete`](#deleting-a-food-item) command.

If you want to see the list of expired food items when using the app, you can use the `expired` command.

![expired popup](images/expiredPopup.png)

**Format:** `expired`

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Adding a food item

The `add` command stores a food item in your food inventory, so that you can start tracking it.
You can then access the food item later on for editing, deleting etc.

**Format:** `add d/DESCRIPTION e/EXPIRY_DATE q/QUANTITY [p/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]…`

* A food item with the same description, expiry date and tags as another food item is considered a duplicate.
* Description and tags are case-insensitive (i.e `d/Apple e/30-12-2020 q/1 t/Red` is the same item as `d/apple e/30-12-2020 q/2 t/red`).
* The quantity field consists of 2 entities - `value` and `unit`. The `value` should come before the `unit`.
  * The `value` is compulsory. It must be a positive number with a maximum of 2 decimal places.
  * The `unit` is optional. If provided, it must consist of only alphabets. Numbers, spaces and special characters are not allowed. If not provided, the default unit - `unit` - will be given.
* The expiry date field only accepts a date in the format of `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD/MM/YYYY`.
* The priority field can either be `high`, `medium` or `low` and is optional. If a priority is not specified, the default priority will be set to `low`.
* The tag field accepts `alphanumeric`, `whitespaces` and these special characters: `#$%&-()`.
  * Tags with only whitespace(s) are not allowed.
  * A food item can have any number of tags (including 0).

**Examples:**
* `add d/canned tuna e/01-01-2021 q/1.5 can p/low`
* `add d/apple pie e/11-10-2020 q/2 p/medium t/frozen t/$15 t/contains nuts`

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Listing all food items

The `list` command shows the complete list of food items in your food inventory.
This command is suitable if you want to get a glimpse of all your food items currently in your kitchen.

**Format:** `list`

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Searching for a food item

The `find` command searches for food items in your food inventory and displays the result on your food list. You can easily find a specific food item, or a group of food items.
The search will return food items with matching description, priority, expiry date and tags (i.e `[d/DESCRIPTION OR [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...] AND [p/PRIORITY] AND [e/EXPIRY DATE] AND [t/TAG] OR ...`).

**Format:** `find [d/DESCRIPTION [MORE_DESCRIPTIONS]...] [e/EXPIRY DATE] [p/PRIORITY] [t/TAG]...`

* You must specify at least one parameter for this command to be valid.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `fish` will match `Fish`.
* The order of the descriptions does not matter. e.g. `Cake Fish` will match `Fish Cake`.
* Only full words in description will be matched. e.g. `fis` will not match `fish`.
* Food items with description matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e `OR` search). e.g. `fish` will return `Fish Cake`, `Tuna Fish`.
* The expiry date field only accepts a date in the format of `DD-MM-YYYY` or `DD/MM/YYYY`.
* The priority field can either be `high`, `medium` or `low`.
* The tag field accepts `alphanumeric`, `whitespaces` and these special characters: `#$%&-()`.
  * Tags with only whitespace(s) are not allowed.
  * Only full tags will be matched e.g. `nuts` will not match `contains nuts`.
  * Food items with tags matching at least one of the search tags will be returned (i.e `OR` search). e.g. `frozen` will return all food items with tags `frozen` regardless of their other tags.

**Examples:**
* `find d/chocolate` returns `Chocolate Pie` and `Chocolate Cake`.
* `find d/apple tuna` returns `Apple Pie` and `Tuna Can`.
* `find e/30-12-2020` returns all food items with expiry date on `30-12-2020`.
* `find d/apple p/high` returns `Apple Pie` and `Apple Jam`, both items have `HIGH` priority.
* `find t/cat t/dog` returns all food items with the tag `cat` or `dog`.
* `find d/biscuits p/medium e/30-12-2020 t/cat t/dog` returns food items with `biscuits` in the description, `MEDIUM` priority, expires on `30-12-2020` and have either `cat` or `dog` as tags.

## Deleting a food item

The `delete` command deletes a specified food item from your food inventory, so that you can stop tracking it.

**Format:** `delete INDEX`

* It deletes the food item at the specified `INDEX`.
  * The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed food list.
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd food item in your food inventory.
* `find tuna` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st food item from the result of the `find` command.

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Editing a food item

The edit command edits the details of an existing food item in your food inventory. If an entry is incorrect, you can easily edit the entry, without deleting and re-adding the food item.

**Format:** `edit INDEX [d/DESCRIPTION] [p/PRIORITY] [q/QUANTITY] [e/EXPIRY DATE] [t/TAG]...`

* It edits the food item at the specified `INDEX`.
  * The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed food list.
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …
* You must specify at least one parameter (other than the `INDEX`) for this command to be valid.
* Existing values will be replaced with the values you input.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the food item will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
  * You can remove all the tags of a food item by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* Similar to the [`add`](#adding-a-food-item) command, a food item with the same description, expiry date and tags as another food item is considered a duplicate.

**Examples:**
* `edit 1 d/baked beans e/1-1-2020` edits the food description and expiry date of the 1st food item to be `baked beans` and `1-1-2020` respectively.
* `edit 2 d/canned tuna q/0.5 can t/` edits the food description of the 2nd food item to be `canned tuna`, quantity to `0.5 can` and clears all existing tags.

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Changing the quantity of a food item

The `changeqty` command changes the quantity of an existing food item in your food inventory. This lets you easily update the current quantity of a food item if you used or stocked up on it.
Use this command if you have bought new food items or used/discarded some existing food items.

**Format:** `changeqty INDEX a/AMOUNT`

* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed food list.
  * The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …
* The amount is the quantity of a food item you want to change by. It is compulsory and can be any non-zero signed number.
  * Choose an amount such that the final quantity is not less than or equal to zero.
  * The amount can be specified up to a maximum of 2 decimal places.
* Do not specify the unit of the food item. The existing unit will be used instead.

**Examples:**
* `changeqty 1 a/+1` increases the quantity of the 1st food item by 1.
* `changeqty 2 a/-2` decreases the quantity of the 2nd food item by 2.

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Sort food items by description

The `sortdesc` command sorts the list of food items by description. This function is useful if you forget a food item's exact spelling, and you are unable to use the `find` command for it.

**Format:** `sortdesc`

* Sorting by description consists of first sorting lexicographically, then by the descriptions' first characters.
* If the first characters are the same letters, descriptions with upper case first characters will be ordered lower than descriptions with lower case first characters. 
* Food items of the same description will be sorted by expiry date from oldest to newest.
* Food items of the same description and same expiry date will be sorted by priority from high to low.

**Examples:**
* A possible valid ordering of descriptions would be: "apple", "apricot", "Acorn"

![sorting by description](images/SortDesc.png)

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Sort food items by expiry date

The `sortexpiry` command sorts the list of food items by expiry date from oldest to newest. With this, you can easily tell which food items are expiring first.

**Format:** `sortexpiry`

* Food items of the same expiry date will be sorted by priority from high to low.
* Food items of the same expiry date and same priority will be sorted by description.

![sorting by expiry date from oldest to newest](images/SortExpiry.png)

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Sort food items by priority

The `sortpriority` command sorts the list of food items by priority from high to low. With this, you can easily tell which food items have higher priority.

**Format:** `sortpriority`

* If two food items have the same priority, they will be ordered by expiry date from oldest to newest.
* If two food items have the same priority and expiry date, they will be ordered by description.

![sorting by priority from HIGH to LOW](images/SortPriority.png)

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Undoing previous command

The `undo` command restores your food inventory to a state before an undoable command was executed. This lets you easily correct mistakes made on your food inventory.
Undoable commands are commands that modify your food inventory's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit` and `clear`)

**Format:** `undo`

**Examples:**
* `delete 1` then `undo` will reverse the delete command.
* `delete 1` `clear` then `undo` will reverse the `clear` command.

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Redoing previously undone command

The `redo` command restores your food inventory to a state before an undo command was executed. This lets you easily redo commands that were incorrectly undone.

**Format:** `redo`

**Examples:**
* `add d/Donut p/medium e/21-2-2021` `undo` then `redo` will reverse the state to when the food item was added.
* `clear` `undo` then `redo` will redo the `clear` command.

## Clearing all entries

The `clear` command clears all entries from your food inventory. This lets you easily clear the starting data, or start on a clean food inventory.
Note that the data saved in your hard disk will also be cleared!

**Format:** `clear`

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Exiting the program

The `exit` command closes the app.

**Format:** `exit`

<div style="text-align: right"><a href="https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-f13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html">^ Back to top</a></div>

## Saving the data

Your food inventory data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.
